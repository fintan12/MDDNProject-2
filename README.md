Project Idea - Alcopop

Alcopop focuses on something more relevant to myself and plenty of other students. I am proposing an alcohol store comparison website where users are able to check online and compare prices of specific beverages from various stores situated in their area. There is currently one app/site like this in New zealand already however it only includes the larger retailers such as countdown and liquor land. Local retailers and newsagents aren’t included. This would give smaller businesses a chance to compete with the larger stores as well as giving consumers more information on products around them. This raises questions regarding the effect large chains have on local businesses.

The existing website is also more directed towards middle aged adults and is missing a lot of drinks that students and young adults tend to prefer. I will look to include these and make the interface more student orientated as a whole. The current interface is very poor and boring in nature.

Due to small liquor stores often not having an online presence users will be able to log into my website and post a listing along with a description of the specific deal they’ve seen, thereby notifying other users of the deals in a particular liquor store at any given time. The site will have a series of images stored that it will match with the according listing depending on what type of drink the user posts. People will be able to browse the website and look at posts associated with different liquor stores that have been uploaded by other users. To make sure false posts aren’t posted other users will be able to up or down vote each post. If it receives enough downvotes it’ll be removed. There is also an option for users to comment.
